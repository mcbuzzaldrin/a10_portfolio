                <p>The paintings were created over the span of 4 years. Many were created in Charleston SC,
                    on the sea island James Island. The work represents many aspects of my lineage and personal journey.</p>
                <p>The environment, is my mind's eye vision.</p>
                <p>Digital works are original works, from concepts and ideas spanning from graffiti to manga,
                    forming a blend of familiar methods. I hope you enjoy the work,
                    inspired to collect a print or nft contributing to future works and more unique collectibles.</p>
